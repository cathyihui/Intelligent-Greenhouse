# Intelligent-Greenhouse
With the development of technologies, the greenhouse can be innovative by implementing sensor network and different web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Socket.io, etc. Minimize the user's intervention and involvement in monitoring and controlling the greenhouse's environment can make greenhouse controller's life more efficient. The main objective of this project is to build a greenhouse model with automatic mode and manual mode. In automatic mode, environmental data like temperature, humidity, light and soil moisture are detected. When some specific environmental conditions are met, the greenhouse can perform some activities automatically. For example, the LED light in the greenhouse can automatically turn on when the greenhouse's light is lower than 50. In manual mode, the same actions' state can be toggled by clicking the buttons on the web page. Thus, by clicking the button on the web page, the LED light can also turn on in manual mode.
